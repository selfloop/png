For creating the VM remember:

- create tmp directory in ~mcc/tmp and set the owner to mcc and
  group to users

- upload binary in BenchKit/bin and set the owner, group and executability

- upload the scripts (and xml files) into BenchKit, set owner, group and executability

- install time, parallel (check for --will-cite) and bc

- for running qemu, check the MCC18 folder.
